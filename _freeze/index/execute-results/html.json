The current mixed evidence for chronovaccination providing an additional competitive edge to vaccine effectiveness is likely due to complex population level interactions between various circadian, environmental, and sociodemographic factors influencing antibody responses to vaccines.  Nonetheless, TODV shows the greatest potential for sub-cohorts of populations, particularly older age, and immunocompromised groups.  In these contexts, this review provides a Person, Place and Time consideration of the factors influencing the outcomes of chronovaccination studies.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Chronovaccination, also known as time of day of vaccination (TODV), is a relatively new but innovative approach for maximising antibody response to vaccines, in turn boosting long term vaccine effectiveness at the population level. In the absence of practical vaccine programming and societal issues around vaccine hesitancy, TODV might be considered a ‘game changer’ in vaccine effectiveness.  However, an unknown in ‘real world’ vaccine programming is how TODV might affect vaccine uptake.  This dichotomy between new approaches to improve vaccine effectiveness and conservative health protection strategies require careful navigation. To this end, this review is a primer for, and summarises recent developments in, the growing field of chronovaccination with the intention of developing interest amongst Public Health professionals, including health economists, behavioural scientists and vaccine delivery and data capture specialists.\nkey-points:\n  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogràphico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis\n  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: chrono_vacc_project.bib\ncsl: nature.csl\ncitation:\n  container-title: Time-of-day of Vaccination\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n## Introduction\nResearchers in epidemiology and public health commonly use three descriptive variables - Person, Place and Time - to look for associations and health determinants explaining health phenomena. This review highlights the key features of the mammalian circadian clock and its role in the daily gating of our immune function, and uses Person, Place and Time to describe the features that impact the close relationship between circadian clocks, their environment, and our immune system. An understanding of these relationships is crucial to our awareness of confounding factors in epidemiological studies addressing the question as to whether daily variations in our immune response extends to our antibody response to vaccination.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\neruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)\nn_eruptions <- length(eruptions)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeline .cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npar(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)\nplot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), \n  pch = \"|\", axes = FALSE)\naxis(1)\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](index_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-1.png){#fig-timeline fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\navg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout .hidden}\n\n```\n[1] 79.83333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average.\n\nStudies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\n\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year.
