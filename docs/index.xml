        <p>Although chronovaccination - controlling the time of day of
vaccination (TODV) to enhance protective immunity - has been described
as a potential paradigm shift in vaccine
immunology<sup><xref alt="1" rid="ref-RN929" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>,
unequivocal evidence for clinical benefit outweighing other societal and
practical considerations has yet to be
established<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.
The current mixed evidence for chronovaccination providing an additional
competitive edge to vaccine effectiveness is likely due to complex
population level interactions between various circadian, environmental,
and sociodemographic factors influencing antibody responses to vaccines.
Nonetheless, TODV shows the greatest potential for sub-cohorts of
populations, particularly older age, and immunocompromised groups. In
these contexts, this review provides a Person, Place and Time
consideration of the factors influencing the outcomes of
chronovaccination studies.</p>

      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>Researchers in epidemiology and public health commonly use three
  descriptive variables - Person, Place and Time - to look for
  associations and health determinants explaining health phenomena. This
  review highlights the key features of the mammalian circadian clock
  and its role in the daily gating of our immune function, and uses
  Person, Place and Time to describe the features that impact the close
  relationship between circadian clocks, their environment, and our
  immune system. An understanding of these relationships is crucial to
  our awareness of confounding factors in epidemiological studies
  addressing the question as to whether daily variations in our immune
  response extends to our antibody response to vaccination.</p>
      <sec id="the-circadian-clock">
        <title>1.1 The circadian clock</title>
        <p>Whether we realise it or not, our internal timing mechanism, or
    clock, dictates our daily lives by harmonising our physiology with
    alterations in our external environment, principally the predicable
    alterations in light and dark that are hallmarks of life on a
    revolving planet. Simplistically, the clock is a network of clock
    genes whose sequential transcription and translation progress over a
    near 24-hour period. These daily cycles, often referred to as
    circadian rhythms (derived from the Latin ‘circa diem’ or ‘about a
    day’), orchestrate virtually all aspects of our physiology,
    including sleep-wake cycles, behaviour and locomotor activity, body
    temperature cycles, cardiovascular and digestive processes,
    endocrine systems and metabolic and immune
    functions<sup><xref alt="3" rid="ref-RN969" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref alt="8" rid="ref-RN930" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.
    A copy of the clock is found in most cell types including cells of
    the immune
    system<sup><xref alt="8" rid="ref-RN930" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref alt="9" rid="ref-RN931" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>,
    but precise and robust coordination of circadian rhythmicity is the
    product of a network of tissue and organ clocks, including a
    ‘master’ clock – primarily influenced by light - situated in the
    suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus brain region that
    dictates the overall pace for synchronising ‘slave’ clocks located
    in virtually all tissues and organs of the
    body<sup><xref alt="10" rid="ref-RN932" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>

      <sec id="clock-plasticity-permits-entrainment">
        <title>1.2 Clock plasticity permits entrainment</title>
        <p>Clocks exist in Nature where the environment is in a constant
    state of flux. Over the course of evolution, clocks have developed
    the capacity to adjust their internal rhythms based on fluctuating
    environmental variables, and a key consequence of this plasticity is
    the ability for circadian clocks to be reset daily, or entrained, by
    these signals, or zeitgebers (‘time givers’) - notably light, but
    can be other cues, for example temperature, food availability,
    hormones<sup><xref alt="11" rid="ref-RN933" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref alt="12" rid="ref-RN1022" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
    and even social
    signals<sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.
    Entrainment allows the clock to readapt upon temporary
    desynchronisation, whether this is due to misalignment between an
    individual’s internal circadian phase and their environment, for
    example when crossing multiple Time Zones (‘jetlag’), as a result of
    abrupt changes to work patterns, such as shift work, or due to
    social
    jetlag<sup><xref alt="14" rid="ref-RN934" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
    - the discrepancy between work and free days, between social and
    biological time. Daylight saving is another example of temporary
    desynchronisation in which misalignment occurs between endogenous
    circadian phase and shifted clock time. While the SCN master
    pacemaker itself adjusts to changes in the environment relatively
    quickly, the slave clocks can take longer to
    adjust<sup><xref alt="15" rid="ref-RN935" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref alt="16" rid="ref-RN936" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.
    Chronic circadian disruption has serious implications for human
    health and can increase the risk for the expression and development
    of neurologic, psychiatric, cardiometabolic, and immune
    disorders<sup><xref alt="17" rid="ref-RN937" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref alt="18" rid="ref-RN458" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="clocks-what-are-they-good-for">
        <title>1.3 Clocks, what are they good for?</title>
        <p>Broadly speaking biological clocks allow us to adapt to and
    anticipate temporal changes in the environment. Clocks have evolved
    over billions of years, possibly in response to the need for single
    celled eukaryotes to ‘escape from light’ to avoid the damaging
    effects of ionising radiation and oxidative stress during cell
    division<sup><xref alt="19" rid="ref-RN941" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref alt="20" rid="ref-RN942" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.
    At the core of mammalian clockwork are a set of conserved cellular
    transcription factor proteins operating as interlocked rhythmic
    transcription-translation feedback loops. The formation, cellular
    trafficking and degradation of different clock protein complexes
    throughout this transcription-translation cycle generates the
    intrinsic nature and stability of the clock, ultimately driving the
    rhythmic expression of the clock genes themselves as well as
    ‘outputs of the clock’ such as clock-controlled
    genes<sup><xref alt="9" rid="ref-RN931" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.
    Essentially then, the rhythmicity of the core clock radiates out to
    the physiological outputs of the clock via interaction with
    clock-controlled genes. The clock therefore does not orchestrate a
    single output, but rather partitions physiological outputs to
    appropriate phases of the day. This is beneficial because by timing
    physiological processes appropriately – or ‘gating’ these processes
    – cellular resources can be effectively and efficiently
    allocated.</p>
        <p>Clocks provide a competitive advantage for the organisms they
    serve. The best demonstration of this is for experiments in plant
    circadian biology where for plants genetically compromised in the
    pacing of their clock - and therefore unable to match the light and
    dark conditions of their environment – survived more poorly than
    plants able to correctly match the external light-dark
    cycle<sup><xref alt="21" rid="ref-RN293" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.
    Clocks anticipate predictable changes in the environment (light
    &amp; dark, warm &amp; cool, for example), rather than reacting to
    change. For example, in plants again, it has been shown that
    photosynthetic machinery is assembled daily before the onset of dawn
    in anticipation of the availability of light so that energy
    harvesting is
    optimised<sup><xref alt="22" rid="ref-RN124" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.
    In mammalian systems the liver and intestine clocks anticipate,
    rather than react to, mealtimes to coordinate food availability with
    nutrient processing and energy
    demand<sup><xref alt="4" rid="ref-RN970" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref alt="23" rid="ref-RN1055" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>The ‘clock as a tool’ for optimising performance is increasingly
    being harnessed in modern life. A good example of this is in the
    arena of elite sports, often occurring across multiple Time Zones,
    where adapting training strategies to align with circadian
    regulation is now viewed as essential. Marginal, yet meaningful,
    advantages over competition can be gained when clock factors are
    keyed into training
    regimes<sup><xref alt="24" rid="ref-RN1047" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.
    ‘Tools for the clock’ are also increasingly apparent, for example
    the development of non-invasive wearable smart devices for
    characterising the clock, viewed as crucial for advancing
    personalised medicine – developments that can be viewed as providing
    an extra edge or dimension via the design of individualised
    treatment plans tailored to the specific needs of
    patients<sup><xref alt="25" rid="ref-RN1057" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref alt="26" rid="ref-RN1054" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>Therefore, clocks themselves inherently provide a competitive
    edge and, thanks to decades of fundamental research into circadian
    clock function, we increasingly see clock knowledge harnessed for
    gaining competitive edges in various societal contexts, many of
    which are referred to as chronotherapies. Chronovaccination – a
    vaccination chronotherapy – has the potential to provide a
    competitive edge in vaccine effectiveness.</p>

      <sec id="circadian-gating">
        <title>1.4 Circadian gating</title>
        <p>A useful concept for the utility of circadian clocks is the idea
    that they gate biological events to particular times of the
    day<sup><xref alt="27" rid="ref-RN910" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.
    While circadian gating has different meanings depending on the types
    of physiology or behaviour under investigation, for example whether
    entrainment to zeitgebers is gated or the amplitude of rhythms are
    modulated, gating can be simply thought of as time periods when the
    clock allows or forbids a particular biological process.
    Chronotherapy harnesses the principles of circadian gating and has
    been, for some time now, regarded as a beneficial and wide-ranging
    socio-economic tool, from the timing of the application of
    agrochemicals<sup><xref alt="28" rid="ref-RN911" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>,
    to the administration of anti-malaria drugs at specific times of the
    day<sup><xref alt="29" rid="ref-RN915" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>,
    to the rhythmic responses to drugs in
    mammals<sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.
    In the latter case drug timing is optimised to enhance drug
    efficacy, reduce toxicity and adverse side effects and improve
    patient outcomes in, for example, cancer
    treatments<sup><xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref alt="32" rid="ref-RN921" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.
    A seminal study in 2014 by Zhang <italic>et
    al.</italic><sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
    found that 119 of the WHO’s list of essential medicines target a
    circadian gene, and since many of these drugs have short half-lives
    (&lt;6 h), the impact of the time of administration on their action
    is
    significant<sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.
    For example, statins are a class of drug that lower cholesterol
    levels by inhibiting HMGCR (HMG-CoA
    reductase)<sup><xref alt="33" rid="ref-RN916" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.
    HMGCR is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and
    its activity peaks during the night. Statins with short half-lives
    showed maximal efficacy when taken in the evening (when their target
    gene was most
    active)<sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.
    There are now numerous examples of health conditions where timed
    drug treatments align with the circadian gated biological target, so
    called ‘clocking the
    drugs’<sup><xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>,
    examples include hypertension, diabetes and
    anti-inflammation<sup><xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref alt="34" rid="ref-RN920" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref alt="35" rid="ref-RN922" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.
    Despite this, many in the scientific community still consider
    ‘time-of-day’ a neglected variable in fundamental biological and
    clinical
    research<sup><xref alt="35" rid="ref-RN922" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref alt="37" rid="ref-RN917" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.
    The lack of circadian enlightenment extends to clinical practice
    where only 4 of the 50 most prescribed drugs in the United States in
    2019 had time-of-day dosing recommendations from the Food and Drug
    Administration, and the 20th World Health Organization’s Model List
    of Essential Medicines makes no mention of dosing
    time<sup><xref alt="38" rid="ref-RN923" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.
    There have therefore been calls for time-of-day to be recognised as
    a key biological variable, similar in status to the ubiquitous sex
    and age variables, in both clinical studies and clinical
    practice<sup><xref alt="35" rid="ref-RN922" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref alt="38" rid="ref-RN923" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref alt="39" rid="ref-RN924" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.
    Indeed, chronotherapies that consider time of day may significantly
    improve clinical trial success and therefore ultimately patient
    care<sup><xref alt="39" rid="ref-RN924" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p>

      <sec id="clock-gating-of-the-immune-response">
        <title>1.5 Clock gating of the immune response</title>
        <p>Innate and adaptive defences constitute two functionally
    distinct, yet intertwined, arms of defence against pathogenic
    invasion or insult, and while the former arm is regarded as a first
    line of defence with no memory of the challenge, adaptive immunity
    provides more finely-tuned, specific recognition of foreign
    particles and the selective expansion of cells prepared to target
    specific pathogens and the development of immunological
    memory<sup><xref alt="40" rid="ref-RN980" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.
    Vaccinations utilise the adaptive immune system to generate
    antibodies towards a target antigen as well as the development of
    ‘immune memory’ - the capacity to respond quicker and more
    effectively when challenged after an initial
    exposure<sup><xref alt="41" rid="ref-RN982" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.
    The function of the adaptive immune system is regulated by the
    circadian clock, with the clock contributing to, for example, the
    24-h regulation of homeostatic processes underlying maintenance of
    adaptive immunity, such as lymphocyte (white blood cell)
    trafficking<sup><xref alt="40" rid="ref-RN980" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref alt="42" rid="ref-RN983" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref alt="43" rid="ref-RN984" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>,
    where the clock essentially modulates leukocyte migration across the
    body, effectively gating the number of leukocytes at specific sites
    throughout the body across the
    day<sup><xref alt="44" rid="ref-RN985" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>It is therefore generally regarded that the circadian clock is a
    potent regulator of immune
    function<sup><xref alt="6" rid="ref-RN968" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref alt="8" rid="ref-RN930" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref alt="40" rid="ref-RN980" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref alt="45" rid="ref-RN966" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>,
    however less clear is why our immunity is gated by the clock? One
    idea is that since metabolic and immune processes are intricately
    linked, over the course of evolution these processes have been
    partitioned<sup><xref alt="46" rid="ref-RN943" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.
    This is evidenced by disruption of clock gene function resulting in
    a host of metabolic disorders, which are often associated with
    immune observable traits, or
    phenotypes<sup><xref alt="47" rid="ref-RN944" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.
    Another idea is that heightened immune sensitivity is an adaptation
    to recurring environmental challenges (such as time-of-day
    prominence of pathogens), with the additional benefit of dimming
    immune responses at times when they are not
    needed<sup><xref alt="9" rid="ref-RN931" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>,
    chiming with the idea that the metabolic costs of immune activation
    are monitored closely by the clock so that immunity-associated
    metabolic costs are kept in check, in turn, enhancing organismal
    fitness<sup><xref alt="45" rid="ref-RN966" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>There are many examples of the detrimental effects of a disrupted
    clock on aggravating disease pathology related to our immune system.
    Employment in rotating shift work is a prime example and has been
    associated with an increased risk of developing inflammatory
    diseases such as psoriasis and irritable bowel
    syndrome<sup><xref alt="48" rid="ref-RN945" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref alt="49" rid="ref-RN946" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.
    It is also well known that chronic inflammatory disease symptoms can
    show time-of-day variation; for example, asthma, whereby symptoms
    are exacerbated in the early
    morning<sup><xref alt="50" rid="ref-RN947" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>,
    or increased joint stiffness and pain in the early morning with
    rheumatoid arthritis
    sufferers<sup><xref alt="51" rid="ref-RN948" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>.
    Other studies have linked social jetlag to higher levels of
    inflammatory markers, and a study of the effects of circadian and
    sleep rhythm disruptions on immune biomarkers among hospital
    healthcare professionals working night shifts and rotating day
    shifts showed that night workers altered pattern expressions of
    immune cells
    biomarkers<sup><xref alt="52" rid="ref-RN1011" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>
    may increase vulnerability to infections and reduce vaccination
    efficiency. Increased inflammation can weaken the body’s defences
    and make individuals more susceptible to infections and reduce
    vaccine
    efficiency<sup><xref alt="52" rid="ref-RN1011" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>However, while this discussion has focussed on the role of the
    clock in gating immune function, the influence of sleep on immune
    function cannot be ignored. Traditionally, clocks, sleep and the
    immune system have been regarded as separate subjects, but it is
    increasingly clear the extent of the interconnectivity between
    circadian rhythms, sleep and immune function, and their implications
    for public health. A key concept worth considering is that, both
    circadian rhythm and sleep disruption happen concurrently every day,
    and this is especially true in modern life through the widespread
    experiences of shift work, light at night, and social jet
    lag<sup><xref alt="53" rid="ref-RN1012" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>.</p>

    <sec id="person---chronotype">
      <title>2 Person - Chronotype</title>
      <p>Timekeeping is not universally the same in populations, and we all
  possess the potential for different ‘settings’ of the clock. These
  versions – or chronotypes - fall on a continuum, at the either end of
  which are individuals colloquially referred to as morning larks and
  night owls. Larks have a morning type (‘morningness’) and prefer to
  awaken early in the morning and feel most active during the earlier
  parts of the day, while owls have an evening type (‘eveningness’),
  preferring to awaken later in the day and typically feel most active
  and motivated in the late evening or at night. Individuals who fall
  between the ends of the continuum are referred to as intermediate
  types<sup><xref alt="54" rid="ref-RN938" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>.
  While chronotype is largely imprinted in small differences in our
  clock genes, changes in morning/evening predisposition adapts with
  life span with morning preference during childhood development,
  evening type in adolescence and early adulthood, then progressively
  morning preference with age
  advancement<sup><xref alt="55" rid="ref-RN939" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref alt="56" rid="ref-RN940" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>.
  Chronotype is a risk factor for cardiometabolic and mental health,
  with evening types being more susceptible to conditions such as
  obesity and bipolar
  disease<sup><xref alt="57" rid="ref-RN1018" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref alt="58" rid="ref-RN1019" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>.
  A systematic review of evidence has also shown a trend for evening
  chronotypes to experience more serious symptoms for immune-mediated
  inflammatory
  diseases<sup><xref alt="59" rid="ref-RN1017" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>.
  There is an appreciation that sex as a biological variable might
  impact immune responses. For example, adult females it seems produce
  higher antibody responses to diverse vaccines against, influenza,
  hepatitis B, yellow fever, rabies, herpes, and smallpox
  viruses<sup><xref alt="60" rid="ref-RN1059" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref alt="61" rid="ref-RN1060" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>.
  However, females may experience greater vulnerability to circadian
  misalignment from factors like shift work, possibly because females

      <p>Modern life and our environment also shape chronotype. Roenneberg
  &amp;
  Merrow<sup><xref alt="18" rid="ref-RN458" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
  describe two distinct environmental scenarios influencing clock
  entrainment; modern/industrial and ancestral/rural entrainment of the
  clock by weak and strong zeitgebers, respectively. Modern/industrial
  entrainment features indoor light and artificial light at night and a
  concomitant reduction in the difference between the maximum and
  minimum amount of light exposure during the day and the level of
  darkness at night. This environment predisposes individuals to later
  chronotypes because of the blurring of the alignment of internal clock
  rhythms with 24-hour day-night patterns. This contrasts with
  ancestral/rural entrainment featuring bright daylight and no
  artificial light at night, where clock rhythms are effectively
  synchronised to the 24-hour day-night pattern. Seasons also modulate
  chronotype; in winter, chronotype is also later, probably due to a
  combination of later sunrise and lower light
  levels<sup><xref alt="63" rid="ref-RN962" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref alt="64" rid="ref-RN989" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>.
  Therefore, a wide range of factors inherent in modern life and our
  environment influence chronotype – although genetics and age play
  roles, external factors such as light, social activities and school or
  work schedules can mask our endogenous chronotype.</p>
      <p>Light at night is a hallmark for our modern lifestyle and is
  thought to be a key driver of social jetlag – a condition resembling a
  mild but chronic form of shift work and epidemiological studies show
  that this correlates with health problems, including the tendency
  towards being overweight. Modern life can therefore be thought of as
  living against the circadian clock in that it induces a sub-optimal
  form of entrainment, a mis-match between the natural rhythm of our
  light:dark environment and our physiology driven by our internal, or
  endogenous, circadian
  clock<sup><xref alt="18" rid="ref-RN458" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.
  The evening, or ‘owl’ chronotype – typical of teenage years – appears
  to be particularly at odds with our modern society that is skewed
  towards morning-orientated activities such that individuals are forced
  to live in a state of circadian misalignment, the schism being their
  innate tendency to wake late and the societal demands of attending
  school or work in the
  morning<sup><xref alt="65" rid="ref-RN979" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>.
  A study of chronotypes in school age children (8-12 years) showed that
  evening types have altered sleep patterns, social jet lag, higher BMI
  and higher metabolic risk (higher values of insulin, glucose,
  triglycerides and
  cholesterol)<sup><xref alt="66" rid="ref-RN1010" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>.
  Also, while light at night not only shifts populations towards later
  chronotypes, modelling studies suggest that it also has the tendency
  to reinforce evening preference and exacerbate circadian and
  sleep-related problems associated with the owl
  chronotype<sup><xref alt="67" rid="ref-RN964" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>.
  In 2022, around 27% of the UK workforce were employed in the evening
  or during the night<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>, compared to
  a reported 16% of adults who usually work a non-daytime schedule in
  2018 in the
  US<sup><xref alt="17" rid="ref-RN937" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.
  Working indoors, in low-light or artificial light conditions with
  relatively little blue light, does not provide the same light exposure
  as natural daylight, and is a risk factor for disruption to the
  harmonious relationship between our endogenous clock rhythms and the
  external environment. Natural daylight at high intensities has been
  shown to be particularly beneficial for advancing the timing of sleep
  to earlier hours thereby lengthening the duration of sleep, and for
  improving sleep
  quality<sup><xref alt="68" rid="ref-RN978" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup>.
  A 2002 publication estimated that around 70% of US workers are
  employed in indoor work
  environments<sup><xref alt="69" rid="ref-RN977" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Outside our homes and work environments, the biological effects of
  light pollution on human wellbeing and natural ecosystems are
  significant, exemplified by a UK Royal Commission on Artificial Light
  in the Environment<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> that
  recognises the explosive growth in outdoor lighting in the UK since
  the 1940’s – and the growing sense of loss of ‘dark skies’ together
  with the resultant cultural
  disconnect<sup><xref alt="70" rid="ref-RN973" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>.
  The Royal Commission comparison of light at night light from 1993 to
  2000 shows that almost every area in the UK has become brighter,
  particularly rural areas such that in 2003 only 22% of England
  possessed pristine night skies compared to 77% for Scotland, although
  in Scotland the main populated areas stretching from Glasgow to
  Edinburgh – the ‘central belt’ - shows almost unbroken levels of light
  pollution, creeping out from the cities and towns to blur any
  distinction between urban and rural
  areas<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref>. The Royal Commission also
  recognised that since light is perceived as a natural and benign
  phenomenon, the insidious and negative issues of ‘light blight’ on our
  natural world are overlooked when any other anthropogenic impact would
  naturally provoke stronger interogation, although artificial light as
  a neglected pollutant was recognised as a public health issue in a
  2023 UK House of Lords Science and Technology Committee
  investigation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref>.</p>
      <p>Place – rurality or urbanity for example – influences the daily
  synchronisation of our internal endogenous clock with the light:dark
  environment, conceptually emboldening a harmonised, ancient, form of
  entrainment or a mis-matched, modern, socially jetlagged, form of
  entrainment, respectively. Although light is thought of as the
  principal zeitgeber, clock epidemiologists have wondered whether
  social cues – hardwired into the fabric of our lives by social
  constructs such as school or work times and governed by digital clock
  time – can counter natural light:dark cues; after all rurality does
  not preclude a modern lifestyle. Roenneberg <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
  teased apart this question of the relative balance of the coupling of
  the circadian clock to natural ‘sun time’ or to constructed ‘social
  time’ in a population sized study – disentangling the cues using the
  principle that within a Time Zone people and live and work to a common
  social time – constant over multiple longitudes – that is at odds with
  sun time that continually changes across longitude. The population
  study used individuals in towns and cities across Germany and measured
  their responses to a questionnaire based around their estimated
  chronotypes, finding that although the clock was principally entrained
  by sun time, individuals in lightly populated areas were more tightly
  coupled to sun time than those living in densely populated areas,
  leading the authors to conclude that the uncoupling was a reflection
  of the emboldening of social cues versus nature’s light–dark cycles.
  Tipping this balance from environmental towards behavioural light–dark
  cycles is predicted to lead to later chronotypes, a characteristic
  increased population
  size<sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.
  Our preference for aligning our clocks to sun time rather than clock
  time is seen with the effects of travel across Time Zones, where the
  clock dynamically re-entrains to external light/dark cycles and
  environmental cues in their new environment, with faster recovery from
  jetlag after westward, as opposed to eastward, travel, possibly as a
  result of a preference for the clock to delay, rather than advance,
  its
  entrainment<sup><xref alt="71" rid="ref-RN1026" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>.
  Where we reside in a Time Zone contributes to our harmony with sun
  time – living on the western edge of a Time Zone where light later in
  the morning extends to later in the evening because of delayed solar
  time can result in circadian misalignment resulting in significant
  deleterious effects on human health
  outcomes<sup><xref alt="72" rid="ref-RN1027" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref alt="73" rid="ref-RN1029" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>.
  For example, cancer-specific mortality has shown to be a function of
  the distance from the eastern border of a Time Zone, with risks
  increasing and longevity decreasing from east to
  west<sup><xref alt="74" rid="ref-RN1030" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup>.
  Reductions in sleep duration due to extra natural light at night
  because of the ‘western edge effect’ was also found to have
  significant adverse effects on human health and on economic
  performance (per capita
  income)<sup><xref alt="75" rid="ref-RN1031" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup>.
  Spain, geographically aligned with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), operates
  on Central European Time (CET), while neighbouring Portugal operates
  on GMT. This discrepancy between social time and sun time leads to
  later bedtimes and meal schedules in regions northwestern Spain,
  potentially affecting sleep and overall circadian
  rhythmicity<sup><xref alt="75" rid="ref-RN1031" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup>.</p>

      <title>4 Time – Immune function</title>
      <p>Despite adaptive immunity occurring over a long period of time
  compared to the innate ‘first line of defence’ response – weeks
  compared to
  days<sup><xref alt="76" rid="ref-RN988" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup>
  – studies have suggested that the timing of the initial immune
  stimulus can have lasting effects on immune
  (patho)physiology<sup><xref alt="76" rid="ref-RN988" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>–<xref alt="79" rid="ref-RN992" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></sup>.
  This has led to the question as to whether daily immune rhythms could
  be used to target the adaptive immune system at the time of highest
  sensitivity to bring about enhanced vaccination
  responses<sup><xref alt="80" rid="ref-RN993" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup>.
  Experimental evidence for variation in antibody production after
  vaccination has been
  obtained<sup><xref alt="81" rid="ref-RN994" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>–<xref alt="85" rid="ref-RN999" ref-type="bibr">85</xref></sup>,
  for example a large, randomised trial of different times of
  vaccination showed that morning vaccination enhanced the antibody
  response to the influenza
  vaccine<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup>.
  There has been some scepticism about the role of the clock in the
  development of adaptive
  immunity<sup><xref alt="86" rid="ref-RN1015" ref-type="bibr">86</xref></sup>
  – after all, how can a 24-h rhythm influence adaptive immunity
  responses forming over days and weeks? However, the step-by-step
  generation of the adaptive immune response over several weeks has been
  traced, where it was found that the timing of the initial immune
  challenge was imprinted on all subsequent downstream
  processes<sup><xref alt="76" rid="ref-RN988" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup>.
  Taken together these studies suggest a ‘sweet spot’ at or just before
  the behavioural activity phase for optimal vaccination – correlating
  with morning vaccination timing for human subjects.</p>
      <p>While daily timing is the focus of TODV, it seems that immune
  function is also sensitive to another predictable timing dimension –
  seasonality – the result of the axial tilt of the Earth combined with
  its orbital path around the Sun. A large population study of UK
  Biobank participants not only showed daytime variation in immune
  parameters, but also a seasonal variation, with lymphocyte numbers
  showing the greatest
  contrast<sup><xref alt="64" rid="ref-RN989" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>.
  Daylength modulates with season and both the intensity and spectral
  composition of light to which people are exposed vary with
  season<sup><xref alt="87" rid="ref-RN1002" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></sup>,
  and while direct evidence for seasonality in humans is
  limited<sup><xref alt="88" rid="ref-RN1003" ref-type="bibr">88</xref></sup>,
  in animals the seasonal clock is generated by changes in thyroid
  hormones in the brain that respond to day length as signalled by the
  pineal hormone melatonin. A study collecting light quality across
  seasons using wearable colour-sensitive ‘actiwatch’ devices in human
  subjects showed that summer subjects were exposed to twice as much
  blue light than winter
  subjects<sup><xref alt="87" rid="ref-RN1002" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></sup>.
  The spectral sensitivity of the photopigment melanopsin, located in
  the human inner retina is known to be greatest for blue light and has
  been shown to mediate many aspects of non-vision related human
  behaviour and physiology such as sleep timing and daily melatonin
  rhythms<sup><xref alt="87" rid="ref-RN1002" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></sup>.
  The relative contribution of blue light is therefore greater in summer
  compared to winter, and while blue-enriched light has positive effects
  on sleep quality, alertness and
  performance<sup><xref alt="89" rid="ref-RN1004" ref-type="bibr">89</xref></sup>,
  the timing of blue light is important such that exposure at night with
  the overuse of electronic devices rich in LED exacerbates social
  jetlag<sup><xref alt="90" rid="ref-RN1005" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref alt="91" rid="ref-RN1006" ref-type="bibr">91</xref></sup>,
  the resultant disrupted clock affecting the timing of hormone
  secretion, the activity of immune cells, and body temperature, and
  changes in mood at different times of day and
  night<sup><xref alt="92" rid="ref-RN1007" ref-type="bibr">92</xref></sup>,
  and has been shown to be a risk factor for psychological
  disorders<sup><xref alt="93" rid="ref-RN1008" ref-type="bibr">93</xref></sup>,
  and
  obesity<sup><xref alt="94" rid="ref-RN1009" ref-type="bibr">94</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In comparison to the well characterised circadian clocks, other
  biological timers – circatidal clocks, linked to the ~12.4-h tidal
  cycle, and circalunar clocks, cycling every ~29.5 days – are less well
  understood and hotly debated to the present
  day<sup><xref alt="95" rid="ref-RN1023" ref-type="bibr">95</xref></sup>.
  Both circalunar rhythms and circatidal rhythms are widespread in
  marine environments, but recent evidence suggests their potential
  influence on human
  health<sup><xref alt="96" rid="ref-RN1014" ref-type="bibr">96</xref></sup>.
  Experiments in sleep laboratories, in which external light sources
  such as moonlight were systematically excluded, show the effect of the
  lunar cycle on sleep, with deep sleep patterns and total sleep time
  negatively and significantly reduced around full
  moon<sup><xref alt="97" rid="ref-RN1013" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup>.
  Circatidal clocks are used by marine organisms to anticipate changes
  linked with the ebb and flow of tides, such as water levels, food
  availability, currents and
  temperature<sup><xref alt="95" rid="ref-RN1023" ref-type="bibr">95</xref></sup>
  and a recent seminal study in humans intriguingly demonstrated 12-h
  rhythms in gene transcript
  levels<sup><xref alt="98" rid="ref-RN1024" ref-type="bibr">98</xref></sup>.
  However there remains a debate as to the potential function of a 12-h
  mammalian clock - after all why would terrestrial animals need a ~12 h
  rhythm generator if they are not subjected to tides. One line of
  thinking is that a mammalian 12-h clock is either an evolutionary
  remnant of the marine circatidal clock or has evolved convergently,
  and that it facilitates the ‘rush hour’ processing of elevated gene
  expression and processing around dawn and
  dusk<sup><xref alt="99" rid="ref-RN1025" ref-type="bibr">99</xref></sup>.
  The clear characterisation of circatidal and circalunar rhythmicity in
  humans is challenging at the practical level, requiring strict control
  of light sources, as well as meal and sleep timing, and there remains
  the problem of elucidating if 12-h rhythms are mechanistically driven
  by the circadian clock, rather than by a dedicated oscillator, or
  simply driven by environmental cues such as
  light<sup><xref alt="95" rid="ref-RN1023" ref-type="bibr">95</xref></sup>.
  A link between immune function and the potential twice daily
  circatidal rhythm anticipation of metabolic stress or circalunar
  rhythm sleep pattern modulation has not been made. Immunity, sleep,
  and metabolism are however intricately intertwined and understanding
  the influence of ultradian rhythms (period shorter than a day) and
  infradian rhythms (period longer than a day) on immune function
  homeostasis will pave the way to appreciating immune processes across
  different timescales.</p>

      <p>Populations therefore feature a rich mixture of chronotypes,
  young/old clocks with natural variation in our genetically
  predetermined lark and owl propensities interacting with, and
  ultimately being shaped by, their surroundings; for example,
  rural/urban settings and summer/winter light environments. Generally,
  less is known about how ‘slave’ clocks, in peripheral organs (brain,
  heart, liver, gut, pancreas, adipose tissue, adrenal glands, lungs,
  and skeletal
  muscle<sup><xref alt="12" rid="ref-RN1022" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>)

  point out, however, that there is likely to be a constellation of
  possible phase entrainments, or ‘phase maps’, describing the
  entrainment between the master and slave clocks; reflecting the idea
  that we entrain differently at different times of our lives, at

      <p>Naturally, the question as to whether daily variations in our
  immune response extends to our antibody response to vaccination has
  been posed. Early work showed mixed evidence for effects of time of
  vaccination on antibody response, possibly as a reflection of low
  sample sizes, variable design, short-term follow-up, and differences
  in vaccine types. However, a large-scale cluster-randomised trial
  examined the influence of the timing of vaccination on influenza
  antibody titres and found that morning vaccination enhanced the
  antibody response to the influenza
  vaccine<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup>.
  Using a prospective cohort study design Zhang <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup>
  showed that vaccination in the morning lead to a stronger immune
  response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In their 2022 review, Otasowie
  <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="1" rid="ref-RN929" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>
  coined the term ‘chronovaccination’ – a term encapsulating the
  evidence of clock gating of the immune response and the potential of
  TODV for maximising vaccine immunogenicity. The authors highlighted
  four clinical studies demonstrating TODV, including the aforementioned
  first large-scale randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of
  different vaccination times for the influenza
  vaccine<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup>,

  immunity induced by the TB vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin

  and for two prospective cohort studies, including the aforementioned
  Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> study, assessing antibody responses
  after administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at different phases of the
  day<sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref alt="101" rid="ref-RN1020" ref-type="bibr">101</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The Otasowie <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="1" rid="ref-RN929" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>
  review, however, sets out conflicting evidence for the optimum TODV.
  The work by Zhang <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup>
  demonstrated that vaccination in the morning (9 am - 11 am) compared
  to vaccination in the afternoon (3 pm - 5 pm) lead to a stronger
  immune response to an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV,
  Sinopharm), while in contrast Wang <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="101" rid="ref-RN1020" ref-type="bibr">101</xref></sup>
  showed, with vaccinating mRNA or Adenovirus based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
  (Pfizer, mRNA bnt162b2 or AstraZeneca, Adenoviral AZD1222) in a larger
  cohort, that antibody responses were higher in those who were
  vaccinated later in the day (11 am - 10 pm) compared to those
  vaccinated in the morning (7 am - 11 am). Wang <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="101" rid="ref-RN1020" ref-type="bibr">101</xref></sup>
  speculated that the use of the inactivated whole virus in the Zhang
  <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup>
  study might explain the difference in the TODV outcomes, and note
  several other potential factors complicating interpretation of the
  outcomes including altered sleep and shift-work patterns of the
  healthcare worker participants of the study potentially influencing
  vaccine responses.</p>
      <p>Recently Hazan <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>
  carried out a retrospective large population cohort analysis of
  timestamped COVID-19 vaccinations (1.5M individuals, age &gt; 12 yo,
  99.2% receiving Pfizer-produced BNT162b2), using COVID-19 breakthrough
  infection and COVID-19–associated emergency department visits and
  hospitalisations as endpoints for cohorts split by vaccination timing
  (morning, afternoon, or evening). This study found lowest rates of
  breakthrough infection with late morning to early afternoon
  vaccination and highest rates associated with evening vaccination.
  Vaccination timing remained significant after adjustment for patient
  age, sex, and comorbidities. The benefits of daytime vaccination were
  concentrated in younger (&lt;20 years old) and older patients (&gt;50
  years
  old)<sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>.
  Although vaccinations were not performed across 24-h cycles, the
  authors were able to demonstrate that the risk of COVID-19
  breakthrough infection as a function of vaccination timing was
  sinusoidal in shape, displaying a periodicity of between 7.4 and 16.7
  hours, considerably shorter than the classical 24-h periodicity of
  circadian rhythms, suggesting that rhythms in vaccine effectiveness
  are potentially ultradian in nature, for example driven by a mammalian
  12-h
  clock<sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>.
  Another retrospective large population cohort study (0.25M
  individuals, age &lt; 6 yo), this time for the varicella vaccine,
  showed that vaccination in the morning and afternoon was associated
  with lower infection rates than evening
  vaccination<sup><xref alt="103" rid="ref-RN1045" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>.
  Like that for the risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, varicella
  infection risk, after adjusting for ethnicity, sex, immunodeficiency,
  and obesity, followed a sinusoidal pattern consistent with a diurnal
  rhythm in vaccine effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Two independent systematic
  reviews<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  have surveyed published studies on the human immune response to
  vaccination at different times of day in order to gauge the evidence
  supporting diurnal variation in the effectiveness of vaccination. Wyse
  <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  noted the challenge in generalising the findings based on the
  heterogeneity of the studies surveyed, however the authors concluded
  that overall there was insufficient overall evidence that
  administration of vaccines at different times of day affected immune
  outcomes. On the other hand, Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  concluded that that morning vaccination enhanced antibody responses in
  adults aged 60 years and older, noting that this age group is a key
  demographic for influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. Studies qualified
  for inclusion in the Vink <italic>et al.</italic> review if they
  measured antigen-specific antibody or T-cell responses following
  vaccination, and if these immune responses were compared between
  participants vaccinated at different time points during the day,
  whereas for Wyse <italic>et al.</italic> studies were included if they
  reported any immune or clinical outcome following vaccination at a
  defined time of day.</p>
      <p>The Wyse <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  review assessed over 3,100 studies, 23 of which met their inclusion
  criteria. These studies were published between 1967 and 2024 and
  almost half of them included reported data collected for SARS-CoV-2
  vaccination programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review authors
  found that most studies were biased by failing to account for immune
  status prior to vaccination, self-selection of vaccination time, or
  due to the presence of confounding factors such as sleep, chronotype,
  and shift work. Of these 23 studies, the optimum TODV was concluded to
  be afternoon (5 studies), morning (5 studies), morning and afternoon
  (1 study), midday (1 study), and morning or late afternoon (1 study),
  with the remaining 10 studies reporting no effect. Of the studies that
  reported an association between TODV and outcome of vaccination, 3
  presented data that could be used to estimate the size of this
  effect<sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref alt="105" rid="ref-RN1032" ref-type="bibr">105</xref></sup>.
  For example, Hazan <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>

  vaccine effectiveness by 8.6–25%.</p>
      <p>Vink <italic>et

  identified 860 records through their literature search, 17 of which
  met their eligibility criteria; five investigated the effect of
  vaccination timing on immune responses to influenza
  vaccines<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref alt="85" rid="ref-RN999" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref alt="106" rid="ref-RN1036" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>–<xref alt="108" rid="ref-RN1038" ref-type="bibr">108</xref></sup>
  and nine explored how time of day influences immune responses to
  SARS-CoV-2
  vaccines<sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref alt="101" rid="ref-RN1020" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref alt="105" rid="ref-RN1032" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,<xref alt="109" rid="ref-RN1039" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>–<xref alt="114" rid="ref-RN1044" ref-type="bibr">114</xref></sup>.
  Eleven out of the 17 studies reported statistically significant
  effects of vaccination timing, with ten reporting stronger antibody
  responses following morning vaccination, while one study favoured
  vaccination later in the day. The strongest evidence for diurnal
  variation was found for influenza vaccines in older adults; sub-group
  analysis for age stratification in the included studies consistently
  showed stronger antibody responses for 60-year-olds or older for
  morning vs afternoon vaccination. Pooled results from two randomised
  controlled
  trials<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref alt="106" rid="ref-RN1036" ref-type="bibr">106</xref></sup>
  for influenza vaccination showed a statistically significant
  small-to-medium standardised mean difference (SMD) in antibody titers
  for adults aged 65 and older (effect size; SMD = 0.32, 95% CI =
  0.21–0.43), with morning vaccination consistently yielding higher
  titers 1 month post-vaccination. However, Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  caution over-interpretation of this reported effect size due to the
  limited number of randomised controlled trials used in the
  meta-analysis.</p>

      <title>7 Discussion</title>
      <p>The role of circadian rhythms in many diverse strands of modern
  society are increasingly apparent, in areas such as health and
  well-being - from increasing understanding of chronic clock disruption
  (e.g., shift work, social jet lag) through to optimal living – the
  integration of personal circadian rhythms into daily schedules for
  eating, exercising, and sleeping to maximise health and performance,
  increasingly regarded as a ‘game changer’ in elite sports
  regimes<sup><xref alt="24" rid="ref-RN1047" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.
  Another example, in agriculture – harnessing knowledge of crop clocks
  to increase yields and resilience, more and more topical with the
  gathering storm of climate change and food security
  challenges<sup><xref alt="28" rid="ref-RN911" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.
  Both examples under the cloak of cultural disconnect from natural
  cycles of light and dark and the insidious creep of artificial light,
  including blue light at inappropriate phases of our day. Modern
  lifestyles embolden living against our natural clock settings, yet
  decades of fundamental scientific research in biological clockwork,
  rewarded with the 2017 Nobel prize in Physiology or
  Medicine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref>, are offering
  opportunities to harness aspects of clock function as chronotherapies.
  One such therapy – chronovaccination - might offer an extra edge in
  vaccine effectiveness. However, is the current evidence strong enough
  to support the idea that it can be a low-cost, low-risk strategy for
  boosting vaccine effectiveness? The case for chronovaccination –
  surveyed in systematic
  reviews<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  – is somewhat patchy. While the influence of TODV is compelling in
  animal studies where environmental conditions are strictly
  controlled<sup><xref alt="76" rid="ref-RN988" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref alt="80" rid="ref-RN993" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup>,
  human populations feature a panoply of individual clock types set in a
  multitude of environments. Young clocks, teenage clocks, old clocks,
  with their spectrum of lark and owl clock ‘settings’. Clocks in rural
  and modern industrial environments, seasonal clocks, socially
  jetlagged clocks - all muddling interpretation of human circadian
  studies assessing the effect of TODV. Large population cohort
  epidemiological studies have been successful in teasing apart
  relationships between our endogenous clock function and the
  environment – for example revealing the association between where we
  live in a Time Zone and
  chrono-disruption<sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.
  Population-level approaches have also been used in chronovacination
  studies<sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref alt="103" rid="ref-RN1045" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>,
  but report modest effect sizes and suffer from potential biases due to
  non-randomisation of cohorts. Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  demonstrated that the strongest evidence for diurnal variation in
  vaccination effectiveness was found for influenza vaccines using
  randomised control trials and Wyse <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  argue that large population randomised trials are the ideal, with the
  power of thousands of participants enabling adjustment for multiple
  demographic and lifestyle factors that might otherwise confound
  detection of an effect of TODV. These would be costly enterprises, but
  Wyse <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  reason that the onus of determining whether effectiveness is a
  function of the TODV should fall to the vaccine producers during
  clinical trials.</p>
      <p>Even if there was a compelling advantage of TODV, would it be
  readily integrated into vaccination programmes? One only has to look
  at the debate around Daylight Saving Time
  (DST)<sup><xref alt="115" rid="ref-RN1048" ref-type="bibr">115</xref></sup>
  to understand the sensitive nature of policies that have disruptive
  effects on social routines. Another relevant example is the idea of
  later school start times for adolescents – designed to align better
  with their clock driven ‘owl’ behaviours – that illustrates how
  interventions, however well intended, can shift the problem onto other
  groups of individuals, in this case later scheduling working against
  teachers and parents own chronotypes and social schedules. Would the
  potential benefit of TODV justify its disruption to well-established
  vaccination programming? On the one hand boosted vaccine effectiveness
  can help improve vaccine hesitancy, with hesitancy identified by the
  WHO as one of the 10 threats to global
  health<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref>. On the other hand, the
  convenience of accessing vaccinations is an important factor for
  vaccine
  uptake<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>,
  and programs scheduled across much of the day offer individual choice
  and convenience that may be expected in a 24-7 society. Conceivably
  immunisation initiatives more narrowly aligned to an optimum TODV may
  be detrimental to vaccine uptake, although nudging based interventions
  have shown potential in bolstering intention to
  vaccinate<sup><xref alt="116" rid="ref-RN1050" ref-type="bibr">116</xref></sup>,
  and may therefore be a useful strategy for fostering confidence in
  time-of-day vaccinations.</p>
      <p>While the benefits of TODV across whole populations remains
  marginal, a clearer case can be made for chronovaccination in adults
  60 years and older, where morning vaccination was more
  beneficial<sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>.
  It has been speculated that immunosenescence - the gradual age-related
  decline in both innate and adaptive immune function - may play a
  role<sup><xref alt="106" rid="ref-RN1036" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref alt="117" rid="ref-RN1051" ref-type="bibr">117</xref></sup>.
  Similarly, immunosuppressed individuals might benefit from
  TODV-mediated boosted vaccine
  effectiveness<sup><xref alt="113" rid="ref-RN1043" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,<xref alt="114" rid="ref-RN1044" ref-type="bibr">114</xref></sup>,
  suggesting that TODV may find a role in targeted age group and
  co-morbidity cohorts. The potential of infant chronovaccination is
  largely an unexplored area, with most studies focussed on adult
  COVID-19 and influenza programmes. A recent study, however, examined
  diurnal patterns of varicella vaccine effectiveness in children -
  finding that immunisation during the late morning to early afternoon
  led to fewer breakthrough infections compared with those vaccinated in
  the
  evening<sup><xref alt="103" rid="ref-RN1045" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>.
  And what of urban-rurality? How might ‘Place’ - the extent of coupling
  to ‘sun time’ - influence sensitivity to TODV? This and the influence
  of seasonality, for example, on TODV are largely unexplored and might
  contribute to understanding the complex relationship between the
  environment, clocks, and immune function. Although a discussion of the
  role of sleep in immune function, and therefore its contribution
  chronovaccination, is not developed in this review, Livieratos
  <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="118" rid="ref-RN1058" ref-type="bibr">118</xref></sup>
  have reviewed the evidence of the impact of circadian and sleep
  factors on influenza vaccine-induced immune responses, emphasising
  that yet another variable – sleep duration – should be considered for
  understanding vaccine-induced antibody responses.</p>
      <p>It was hoped that the award of the clock biology Nobel Prize in
  2017 would emphasise the time-of-day reporting in biology and
  medicine. However, Nelson <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="37" rid="ref-RN917" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>
  report that the time-of-day variable remains largely ignored. Much
  commentary on the future direction of chronovaccination emphasise the
  importance of systematically recording the time-of-day at which
  vaccines are administered, yet to many chronobiologists it remains a
  puzzle why such a fundamental biological variable is regularly
  overlooked in the first place. One factor may be the increased
  resources and costs that accompany properly designed multi time-point
  circadian assays; however circadian biologists would no doubt argue
  that biological studies cannot be reliably replicated – a fundamental
  tenet of science – unless time-of-day is recorded. Another important
  consideration is that internal biological time (circadian phase) can
  vary considerably, the consequence of modern lifestyles and the high
  chance of desynchrony due to many of the Person, Place and Time
  factors described here
  (<xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-variables">Table 1</xref>). For example,
  nurses’ circadian rhythms in body temperature have been shown to be
  significantly misaligned due to shift working patterns, causing work
  and sleep schedules to be out of phase with each
  other<sup><xref alt="119" rid="ref-RN1052" ref-type="bibr">119</xref></sup>.
  Both external time of vaccination and internal (biological) time
  recording are therefore important factors, with internal time
  recording representing a particular technical
  challenge<sup><xref alt="53" rid="ref-RN1012" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>.
  However, research on circadian wearable devices that continuously
  track body movement, heart rate, temperature, and light exposure has
  increased significantly over the past decade, are continually
  improving and offer a non-invasive method to capturing real-life
  circadian
  rhythms<sup><xref alt="26" rid="ref-RN1054" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>‘Time will tell’ if chronovaccination finds a role in delivering an
  edge to vaccine effectiveness. There remain many challenges, not only
  in establishing clear clinical benefits, but other hurdles akin to
  practical and societal issues. The general public’s growing interest
  of the role of circadian rhythms in relation to health and well-being,
  or ‘circadian hygiene’, might ultimately drive individual awareness of
  optimal times for vaccination. Therefore, as Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  allude to in their review, the future vaccine customer may well regard
  optimal vaccination as an hourly continuous variable in relation to
  their personal circadian phase rather than the more blunt binary
  (morning <italic>vs</italic> afternoon) variable we currently
  consider.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="conclusions">
      <title>8 Conclusions</title>
      <p>Chronovaccination studies have been demonstrably hampered by the
  panoply of confounding factors inherent to population structures and
  our modern lifestyles. Understanding endogenous human biological
  time-keeping in the context of their exogenous settings is likely key
  to disentangling the relative influences of covariates. Nonetheless,
  TODV as a chronotherapy shows promise for older age and
  immunosuppressed groups, and while the effect size may prove to be
  modest, their practical significance could be viewed as a marginal
  gain in vaccine effectiveness, in the same way that knowledge of
  clockwork is harnessed as a competitive advantage in numerous other
  areas of society. Key hurdles in the adoption of chronovaccination are
  whether society buys into the idea and whether health agencies
  conclude that the fragility of vaccine uptake might ultimately be
  further jeopardised by changes to well established vaccination
  programmes.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Although chronovaccination - controlling the time of day of
vaccination (TODV) to enhance protective immunity - has been described
as a potential paradigm shift in vaccine
immunology<sup><xref alt="1" rid="ref-RN929-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>,
unequivocal evidence for clinical benefit outweighing other societal and
practical considerations has yet to be
established<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.
The current mixed evidence for chronovaccination providing an additional
competitive edge to vaccine effectiveness is likely due to complex
population level interactions between various circadian, environmental,
and sociodemographic factors influencing antibody responses to vaccines.
Nonetheless, TODV shows the greatest potential for sub-cohorts of
populations, particularly older age, and immunocompromised groups. In
these contexts, this review provides a Person, Place and Time
consideration of the factors influencing the outcomes of

        <title>1 Introduction</title>
        <p>Researchers in epidemiology and public health commonly use three
  descriptive variables - Person, Place and Time - to look for
  associations and health determinants explaining health phenomena. This
  review highlights the key features of the mammalian circadian clock
  and its role in the daily gating of our immune function, and uses
  Person, Place and Time to describe the features that impact the close
  relationship between circadian clocks, their environment, and our
  immune system. An understanding of these relationships is crucial to
  our awareness of confounding factors in epidemiological studies
  addressing the question as to whether daily variations in our immune
  response extends to our antibody response to vaccination.</p>

          <title>1.1 The circadian clock</title>
          <p>Whether we realise it or not, our internal timing mechanism, or
    clock, dictates our daily lives by harmonising our physiology with
    alterations in our external environment, principally the predicable
    alterations in light and dark that are hallmarks of life on a
    revolving planet. Simplistically, the clock is a network of clock
    genes whose sequential transcription and translation progress over a
    near 24-hour period. These daily cycles, often referred to as
    circadian rhythms (derived from the Latin ‘circa diem’ or ‘about a
    day’), orchestrate virtually all aspects of our physiology,
    including sleep-wake cycles, behaviour and locomotor activity, body
    temperature cycles, cardiovascular and digestive processes,
    endocrine systems and metabolic and immune
    functions<sup><xref alt="3" rid="ref-RN969-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref alt="8" rid="ref-RN930-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.
    A copy of the clock is found in most cell types including cells of
    the immune
    system<sup><xref alt="8" rid="ref-RN930-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref alt="9" rid="ref-RN931-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>,
    but precise and robust coordination of circadian rhythmicity is the
    product of a network of tissue and organ clocks, including a
    ‘master’ clock – primarily influenced by light - situated in the
    suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus brain region that
    dictates the overall pace for synchronising ‘slave’ clocks located
    in virtually all tissues and organs of the
    body<sup><xref alt="10" rid="ref-RN932-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>

          <title>1.2 Clock plasticity permits entrainment</title>
          <p>Clocks exist in Nature where the environment is in a constant
    state of flux. Over the course of evolution, clocks have developed
    the capacity to adjust their internal rhythms based on fluctuating
    environmental variables, and a key consequence of this plasticity is
    the ability for circadian clocks to be reset daily, or entrained, by
    these signals, or zeitgebers (‘time givers’) - notably light, but
    can be other cues, for example temperature, food availability,
    hormones<sup><xref alt="11" rid="ref-RN933-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref alt="12" rid="ref-RN1022-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
    and even social
    signals<sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.
    Entrainment allows the clock to readapt upon temporary
    desynchronisation, whether this is due to misalignment between an
    individual’s internal circadian phase and their environment, for
    example when crossing multiple Time Zones (‘jetlag’), as a result of
    abrupt changes to work patterns, such as shift work, or due to
    social
    jetlag<sup><xref alt="14" rid="ref-RN934-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
    - the discrepancy between work and free days, between social and
    biological time. Daylight saving is another example of temporary
    desynchronisation in which misalignment occurs between endogenous
    circadian phase and shifted clock time. While the SCN master
    pacemaker itself adjusts to changes in the environment relatively
    quickly, the slave clocks can take longer to
    adjust<sup><xref alt="15" rid="ref-RN935-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref alt="16" rid="ref-RN936-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.
    Chronic circadian disruption has serious implications for human
    health and can increase the risk for the expression and development
    of neurologic, psychiatric, cardiometabolic, and immune
    disorders<sup><xref alt="17" rid="ref-RN937-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref alt="18" rid="ref-RN458-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>

          <title>1.3 Clocks, what are they good for?</title>
          <p>Broadly speaking biological clocks allow us to adapt to and
    anticipate temporal changes in the environment. Clocks have evolved
    over billions of years, possibly in response to the need for single
    celled eukaryotes to ‘escape from light’ to avoid the damaging
    effects of ionising radiation and oxidative stress during cell
    division<sup><xref alt="19" rid="ref-RN941-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref alt="20" rid="ref-RN942-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.
    At the core of mammalian clockwork are a set of conserved cellular
    transcription factor proteins operating as interlocked rhythmic
    transcription-translation feedback loops. The formation, cellular
    trafficking and degradation of different clock protein complexes
    throughout this transcription-translation cycle generates the
    intrinsic nature and stability of the clock, ultimately driving the
    rhythmic expression of the clock genes themselves as well as
    ‘outputs of the clock’ such as clock-controlled
    genes<sup><xref alt="9" rid="ref-RN931-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.
    Essentially then, the rhythmicity of the core clock radiates out to
    the physiological outputs of the clock via interaction with
    clock-controlled genes. The clock therefore does not orchestrate a
    single output, but rather partitions physiological outputs to
    appropriate phases of the day. This is beneficial because by timing
    physiological processes appropriately – or ‘gating’ these processes
    – cellular resources can be effectively and efficiently
    allocated.</p>
          <p>Clocks provide a competitive advantage for the organisms they
    serve. The best demonstration of this is for experiments in plant
    circadian biology where for plants genetically compromised in the
    pacing of their clock - and therefore unable to match the light and
    dark conditions of their environment – survived more poorly than
    plants able to correctly match the external light-dark
    cycle<sup><xref alt="21" rid="ref-RN293-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.
    Clocks anticipate predictable changes in the environment (light
    &amp; dark, warm &amp; cool, for example), rather than reacting to
    change. For example, in plants again, it has been shown that
    photosynthetic machinery is assembled daily before the onset of dawn
    in anticipation of the availability of light so that energy
    harvesting is
    optimised<sup><xref alt="22" rid="ref-RN124-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.
    In mammalian systems the liver and intestine clocks anticipate,
    rather than react to, mealtimes to coordinate food availability with
    nutrient processing and energy
    demand<sup><xref alt="4" rid="ref-RN970-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref alt="23" rid="ref-RN1055-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p>The ‘clock as a tool’ for optimising performance is increasingly
    being harnessed in modern life. A good example of this is in the
    arena of elite sports, often occurring across multiple Time Zones,
    where adapting training strategies to align with circadian
    regulation is now viewed as essential. Marginal, yet meaningful,
    advantages over competition can be gained when clock factors are
    keyed into training
    regimes<sup><xref alt="24" rid="ref-RN1047-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.
    ‘Tools for the clock’ are also increasingly apparent, for example
    the development of non-invasive wearable smart devices for
    characterising the clock, viewed as crucial for advancing
    personalised medicine – developments that can be viewed as providing
    an extra edge or dimension via the design of individualised
    treatment plans tailored to the specific needs of
    patients<sup><xref alt="25" rid="ref-RN1057-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref alt="26" rid="ref-RN1054-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p>Therefore, clocks themselves inherently provide a competitive
    edge and, thanks to decades of fundamental research into circadian
    clock function, we increasingly see clock knowledge harnessed for
    gaining competitive edges in various societal contexts, many of
    which are referred to as chronotherapies. Chronovaccination – a
    vaccination chronotherapy – has the potential to provide a
    competitive edge in vaccine effectiveness.</p>

          <title>1.4 Circadian gating</title>
          <p>A useful concept for the utility of circadian clocks is the idea
    that they gate biological events to particular times of the
    day<sup><xref alt="27" rid="ref-RN910-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.
    While circadian gating has different meanings depending on the types
    of physiology or behaviour under investigation, for example whether
    entrainment to zeitgebers is gated or the amplitude of rhythms are
    modulated, gating can be simply thought of as time periods when the
    clock allows or forbids a particular biological process.
    Chronotherapy harnesses the principles of circadian gating and has
    been, for some time now, regarded as a beneficial and wide-ranging
    socio-economic tool, from the timing of the application of
    agrochemicals<sup><xref alt="28" rid="ref-RN911-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>,
    to the administration of anti-malaria drugs at specific times of the
    day<sup><xref alt="29" rid="ref-RN915-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>,
    to the rhythmic responses to drugs in
    mammals<sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.
    In the latter case drug timing is optimised to enhance drug
    efficacy, reduce toxicity and adverse side effects and improve
    patient outcomes in, for example, cancer
    treatments<sup><xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref alt="32" rid="ref-RN921-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.
    A seminal study in 2014 by Zhang <italic>et
    al.</italic><sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
    found that 119 of the WHO’s list of essential medicines target a
    circadian gene, and since many of these drugs have short half-lives
    (&lt;6 h), the impact of the time of administration on their action
    is
    significant<sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.
    For example, statins are a class of drug that lower cholesterol
    levels by inhibiting HMGCR (HMG-CoA
    reductase)<sup><xref alt="33" rid="ref-RN916-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.
    HMGCR is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and
    its activity peaks during the night. Statins with short half-lives
    showed maximal efficacy when taken in the evening (when their target
    gene was most
    active)<sup><xref alt="30" rid="ref-RN912-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.
    There are now numerous examples of health conditions where timed
    drug treatments align with the circadian gated biological target, so
    called ‘clocking the
    drugs’<sup><xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>,
    examples include hypertension, diabetes and
    anti-inflammation<sup><xref alt="31" rid="ref-RN913-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref alt="34" rid="ref-RN920-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref alt="35" rid="ref-RN922-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.
    Despite this, many in the scientific community still consider
    ‘time-of-day’ a neglected variable in fundamental biological and
    clinical
    research<sup><xref alt="35" rid="ref-RN922-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref alt="37" rid="ref-RN917-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.
    The lack of circadian enlightenment extends to clinical practice
    where only 4 of the 50 most prescribed drugs in the United States in
    2019 had time-of-day dosing recommendations from the Food and Drug
    Administration, and the 20th World Health Organization’s Model List
    of Essential Medicines makes no mention of dosing
    time<sup><xref alt="38" rid="ref-RN923-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.
    There have therefore been calls for time-of-day to be recognised as
    a key biological variable, similar in status to the ubiquitous sex
    and age variables, in both clinical studies and clinical
    practice<sup><xref alt="35" rid="ref-RN922-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref alt="38" rid="ref-RN923-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref alt="39" rid="ref-RN924-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.
    Indeed, chronotherapies that consider time of day may significantly
    improve clinical trial success and therefore ultimately patient
    care<sup><xref alt="39" rid="ref-RN924-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p>

          <title>1.5 Clock gating of the immune response</title>
          <p>Innate and adaptive defences constitute two functionally
    distinct, yet intertwined, arms of defence against pathogenic
    invasion or insult, and while the former arm is regarded as a first
    line of defence with no memory of the challenge, adaptive immunity
    provides more finely-tuned, specific recognition of foreign
    particles and the selective expansion of cells prepared to target
    specific pathogens and the development of immunological
    memory<sup><xref alt="40" rid="ref-RN980-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.
    Vaccinations utilise the adaptive immune system to generate
    antibodies towards a target antigen as well as the development of
    ‘immune memory’ - the capacity to respond quicker and more
    effectively when challenged after an initial
    exposure<sup><xref alt="41" rid="ref-RN982-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.
    The function of the adaptive immune system is regulated by the
    circadian clock, with the clock contributing to, for example, the
    24-h regulation of homeostatic processes underlying maintenance of
    adaptive immunity, such as lymphocyte (white blood cell)
    trafficking<sup><xref alt="40" rid="ref-RN980-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref alt="42" rid="ref-RN983-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref alt="43" rid="ref-RN984-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>,
    where the clock essentially modulates leukocyte migration across the
    body, effectively gating the number of leukocytes at specific sites
    throughout the body across the
    day<sup><xref alt="44" rid="ref-RN985-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p>It is therefore generally regarded that the circadian clock is a
    potent regulator of immune
    function<sup><xref alt="6" rid="ref-RN968-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref alt="8" rid="ref-RN930-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref alt="40" rid="ref-RN980-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref alt="45" rid="ref-RN966-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>,
    however less clear is why our immunity is gated by the clock? One
    idea is that since metabolic and immune processes are intricately
    linked, over the course of evolution these processes have been
    partitioned<sup><xref alt="46" rid="ref-RN943-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.
    This is evidenced by disruption of clock gene function resulting in
    a host of metabolic disorders, which are often associated with
    immune observable traits, or
    phenotypes<sup><xref alt="47" rid="ref-RN944-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.
    Another idea is that heightened immune sensitivity is an adaptation
    to recurring environmental challenges (such as time-of-day
    prominence of pathogens), with the additional benefit of dimming
    immune responses at times when they are not
    needed<sup><xref alt="9" rid="ref-RN931-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>,
    chiming with the idea that the metabolic costs of immune activation
    are monitored closely by the clock so that immunity-associated
    metabolic costs are kept in check, in turn, enhancing organismal
    fitness<sup><xref alt="45" rid="ref-RN966-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p>There are many examples of the detrimental effects of a disrupted
    clock on aggravating disease pathology related to our immune system.
    Employment in rotating shift work is a prime example and has been
    associated with an increased risk of developing inflammatory
    diseases such as psoriasis and irritable bowel
    syndrome<sup><xref alt="48" rid="ref-RN945-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref alt="49" rid="ref-RN946-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.
    It is also well known that chronic inflammatory disease symptoms can
    show time-of-day variation; for example, asthma, whereby symptoms
    are exacerbated in the early
    morning<sup><xref alt="50" rid="ref-RN947-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>,
    or increased joint stiffness and pain in the early morning with
    rheumatoid arthritis
    sufferers<sup><xref alt="51" rid="ref-RN948-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>.
    Other studies have linked social jetlag to higher levels of
    inflammatory markers, and a study of the effects of circadian and
    sleep rhythm disruptions on immune biomarkers among hospital
    healthcare professionals working night shifts and rotating day
    shifts showed that night workers altered pattern expressions of
    immune cells
    biomarkers<sup><xref alt="52" rid="ref-RN1011-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>
    may increase vulnerability to infections and reduce vaccination
    efficiency. Increased inflammation can weaken the body’s defences
    and make individuals more susceptible to infections and reduce
    vaccine
    efficiency<sup><xref alt="52" rid="ref-RN1011-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>.</p>
          <p>However, while this discussion has focussed on the role of the
    clock in gating immune function, the influence of sleep on immune
    function cannot be ignored. Traditionally, clocks, sleep and the
    immune system have been regarded as separate subjects, but it is
    increasingly clear the extent of the interconnectivity between
    circadian rhythms, sleep and immune function, and their implications
    for public health. A key concept worth considering is that, both
    circadian rhythm and sleep disruption happen concurrently every day,
    and this is especially true in modern life through the widespread
    experiences of shift work, light at night, and social jet
    lag<sup><xref alt="53" rid="ref-RN1012-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>2 Person - Chronotype</title>
        <p>Timekeeping is not universally the same in populations, and we all
  possess the potential for different ‘settings’ of the clock. These
  versions – or chronotypes - fall on a continuum, at the either end of
  which are individuals colloquially referred to as morning larks and
  night owls. Larks have a morning type (‘morningness’) and prefer to
  awaken early in the morning and feel most active during the earlier
  parts of the day, while owls have an evening type (‘eveningness’),
  preferring to awaken later in the day and typically feel most active
  and motivated in the late evening or at night. Individuals who fall
  between the ends of the continuum are referred to as intermediate
  types<sup><xref alt="54" rid="ref-RN938-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>.
  While chronotype is largely imprinted in small differences in our
  clock genes, changes in morning/evening predisposition adapts with
  life span with morning preference during childhood development,
  evening type in adolescence and early adulthood, then progressively
  morning preference with age
  advancement<sup><xref alt="55" rid="ref-RN939-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref alt="56" rid="ref-RN940-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>.
  Chronotype is a risk factor for cardiometabolic and mental health,
  with evening types being more susceptible to conditions such as
  obesity and bipolar
  disease<sup><xref alt="57" rid="ref-RN1018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref alt="58" rid="ref-RN1019-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>.
  A systematic review of evidence has also shown a trend for evening
  chronotypes to experience more serious symptoms for immune-mediated
  inflammatory
  diseases<sup><xref alt="59" rid="ref-RN1017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>.
  There is an appreciation that sex as a biological variable might
  impact immune responses. For example, adult females it seems produce
  higher antibody responses to diverse vaccines against, influenza,
  hepatitis B, yellow fever, rabies, herpes, and smallpox
  viruses<sup><xref alt="60" rid="ref-RN1059-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref alt="61" rid="ref-RN1060-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>.
  However, females may experience greater vulnerability to circadian
  misalignment from factors like shift work, possibly because females
  are more likely to be classified as morning types as compared to males
  meaning that there is potentially more severe misalignment with the
  24-hour day-night cycle imposed by shift

  &amp;
  Merrow<sup><xref alt="18" rid="ref-RN458-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
  describe two distinct environmental scenarios influencing clock
  entrainment; modern/industrial and ancestral/rural entrainment of the
  clock by weak and strong zeitgebers, respectively. Modern/industrial
  entrainment features indoor light and artificial light at night and a
  concomitant reduction in the difference between the maximum and
  minimum amount of light exposure during the day and the level of
  darkness at night. This environment predisposes individuals to later
  chronotypes because of the blurring of the alignment of internal clock
  rhythms with 24-hour day-night patterns. This contrasts with
  ancestral/rural entrainment featuring bright daylight and no
  artificial light at night, where clock rhythms are effectively
  synchronised to the 24-hour day-night pattern. Seasons also modulate
  chronotype; in winter, chronotype is also later, probably due to a
  combination of later sunrise and lower light
  levels<sup><xref alt="63" rid="ref-RN962-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref alt="64" rid="ref-RN989-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>.
  Therefore, a wide range of factors inherent in modern life and our
  environment influence chronotype – although genetics and age play
  roles, external factors such as light, social activities and school or
  work schedules can mask our endogenous chronotype.</p>
        <p>Light at night is a hallmark for our modern lifestyle and is
  thought to be a key driver of social jetlag – a condition resembling a
  mild but chronic form of shift work and epidemiological studies show
  that this correlates with health problems, including the tendency
  towards being overweight. Modern life can therefore be thought of as
  living against the circadian clock in that it induces a sub-optimal
  form of entrainment, a mis-match between the natural rhythm of our
  light:dark environment and our physiology driven by our internal, or
  endogenous, circadian
  clock<sup><xref alt="18" rid="ref-RN458-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.
  The evening, or ‘owl’ chronotype – typical of teenage years – appears
  to be particularly at odds with our modern society that is skewed
  towards morning-orientated activities such that individuals are forced
  to live in a state of circadian misalignment, the schism being their
  innate tendency to wake late and the societal demands of attending
  school or work in the
  morning<sup><xref alt="65" rid="ref-RN979-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>.
  A study of chronotypes in school age children (8-12 years) showed that
  evening types have altered sleep patterns, social jet lag, higher BMI
  and higher metabolic risk (higher values of insulin, glucose,

  Also, while light at night not only shifts populations towards later
  chronotypes, modelling studies suggest that it also has the tendency
  to reinforce evening preference and exacerbate circadian and
  sleep-related problems associated with the owl
  chronotype<sup><xref alt="67" rid="ref-RN964-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>.
  In 2022, around 27% of the UK workforce were employed in the evening
  or during the night<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-article">1</xref>, compared to
  a reported 16% of adults who usually work a non-daytime schedule in
  2018 in the
  US<sup><xref alt="17" rid="ref-RN937-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.
  Working indoors, in low-light or artificial light conditions with
  relatively little blue light, does not provide the same light exposure
  as natural daylight, and is a risk factor for disruption to the
  harmonious relationship between our endogenous clock rhythms and the
  external environment. Natural daylight at high intensities has been
  shown to be particularly beneficial for advancing the timing of sleep
  to earlier hours thereby lengthening the duration of sleep, and for
  improving sleep
  quality<sup><xref alt="68" rid="ref-RN978-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup>.
  A 2002 publication estimated that around 70% of US workers are
  employed in indoor work
  environments<sup><xref alt="69" rid="ref-RN977-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>Outside our homes and work environments, the biological effects of
  light pollution on human wellbeing and natural ecosystems are
  significant, exemplified by a UK Royal Commission on Artificial Light
  in the Environment<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-nb-article">2</xref> that
  recognises the explosive growth in outdoor lighting in the UK since
  the 1940’s – and the growing sense of loss of ‘dark skies’ together
  with the resultant cultural
  disconnect<sup><xref alt="70" rid="ref-RN973-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>.
  The Royal Commission comparison of light at night light from 1993 to
  2000 shows that almost every area in the UK has become brighter,
  particularly rural areas such that in 2003 only 22% of England
  possessed pristine night skies compared to 77% for Scotland, although
  in Scotland the main populated areas stretching from Glasgow to
  Edinburgh – the ‘central belt’ - shows almost unbroken levels of light
  pollution, creeping out from the cities and towns to blur any
  distinction between urban and rural
  areas<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-nb-article">3</xref>. The Royal Commission also
  recognised that since light is perceived as a natural and benign
  phenomenon, the insidious and negative issues of ‘light blight’ on our
  natural world are overlooked when any other anthropogenic impact would
  naturally provoke stronger interogation, although artificial light as
  a neglected pollutant was recognised as a public health issue in a
  2023 UK House of Lords Science and Technology Committee
  investigation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-nb-article">4</xref>.</p>
        <p>Place – rurality or urbanity for example – influences the daily
  synchronisation of our internal endogenous clock with the light:dark
  environment, conceptually emboldening a harmonised, ancient, form of
  entrainment or a mis-matched, modern, socially jetlagged, form of
  entrainment, respectively. Although light is thought of as the
  principal zeitgeber, clock epidemiologists have wondered whether
  social cues – hardwired into the fabric of our lives by social
  constructs such as school or work times and governed by digital clock
  time – can counter natural light:dark cues; after all rurality does
  not preclude a modern lifestyle. Roenneberg <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
  teased apart this question of the relative balance of the coupling of
  the circadian clock to natural ‘sun time’ or to constructed ‘social
  time’ in a population sized study – disentangling the cues using the
  principle that within a Time Zone people and live and work to a common
  social time – constant over multiple longitudes – that is at odds with
  sun time that continually changes across longitude. The population
  study used individuals in towns and cities across Germany and measured
  their responses to a questionnaire based around their estimated
  chronotypes, finding that although the clock was principally entrained
  by sun time, individuals in lightly populated areas were more tightly
  coupled to sun time than those living in densely populated areas,
  leading the authors to conclude that the uncoupling was a reflection
  of the emboldening of social cues versus nature’s light–dark cycles.
  Tipping this balance from environmental towards behavioural light–dark
  cycles is predicted to lead to later chronotypes, a characteristic
  increased population
  size<sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.
  Our preference for aligning our clocks to sun time rather than clock
  time is seen with the effects of travel across Time Zones, where the
  clock dynamically re-entrains to external light/dark cycles and
  environmental cues in their new environment, with faster recovery from
  jetlag after westward, as opposed to eastward, travel, possibly as a
  result of a preference for the clock to delay, rather than advance,
  its
  entrainment<sup><xref alt="71" rid="ref-RN1026-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>.
  Where we reside in a Time Zone contributes to our harmony with sun
  time – living on the western edge of a Time Zone where light later in
  the morning extends to later in the evening because of delayed solar
  time can result in circadian misalignment resulting in significant
  deleterious effects on human health
  outcomes<sup><xref alt="72" rid="ref-RN1027-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref alt="73" rid="ref-RN1029-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>.
  For example, cancer-specific mortality has shown to be a function of
  the distance from the eastern border of a Time Zone, with risks
  increasing and longevity decreasing from east to
  west<sup><xref alt="74" rid="ref-RN1030-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup>.
  Reductions in sleep duration due to extra natural light at night
  because of the ‘western edge effect’ was also found to have
  significant adverse effects on human health and on economic
  performance (per capita
  income)<sup><xref alt="75" rid="ref-RN1031-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup>.
  Spain, geographically aligned with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), operates
  on Central European Time (CET), while neighbouring Portugal operates
  on GMT. This discrepancy between social time and sun time leads to
  later bedtimes and meal schedules in regions northwestern Spain,
  potentially affecting sleep and overall circadian
  rhythmicity<sup><xref alt="75" rid="ref-RN1031-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>4 Time – Immune function</title>
        <p>Despite adaptive immunity occurring over a long period of time
  compared to the innate ‘first line of defence’ response – weeks
  compared to
  days<sup><xref alt="76" rid="ref-RN988-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup>
  – studies have suggested that the timing of the initial immune

  This has led to the question as to whether daily immune rhythms could
  be used to target the adaptive immune system at the time of highest
  sensitivity to bring about enhanced vaccination
  responses<sup><xref alt="80" rid="ref-RN993-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup>.
  Experimental evidence for variation in antibody production after
  vaccination has been
  obtained<sup><xref alt="81" rid="ref-RN994-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>–<xref alt="85" rid="ref-RN999-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">85</xref></sup>,
  for example a large, randomised trial of different times of
  vaccination showed that morning vaccination enhanced the antibody
  response to the influenza
  vaccine<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup>.
  There has been some scepticism about the role of the clock in the
  development of adaptive
  immunity<sup><xref alt="86" rid="ref-RN1015-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">86</xref></sup>
  – after all, how can a 24-h rhythm influence adaptive immunity
  responses forming over days and weeks? However, the step-by-step
  generation of the adaptive immune response over several weeks has been
  traced, where it was found that the timing of the initial immune
  challenge was imprinted on all subsequent downstream
  processes<sup><xref alt="76" rid="ref-RN988-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup>.
  Taken together these studies suggest a ‘sweet spot’ at or just before
  the behavioural activity phase for optimal vaccination – correlating
  with morning vaccination timing for human subjects.</p>
        <p>While daily timing is the focus of TODV, it seems that immune
  function is also sensitive to another predictable timing dimension –
  seasonality – the result of the axial tilt of the Earth combined with
  its orbital path around the Sun. A large population study of UK
  Biobank participants not only showed daytime variation in immune
  parameters, but also a seasonal variation, with lymphocyte numbers
  showing the greatest
  contrast<sup><xref alt="64" rid="ref-RN989-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>.
  Daylength modulates with season and both the intensity and spectral
  composition of light to which people are exposed vary with
  season<sup><xref alt="87" rid="ref-RN1002-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></sup>,
  and while direct evidence for seasonality in humans is
  limited<sup><xref alt="88" rid="ref-RN1003-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">88</xref></sup>,
  in animals the seasonal clock is generated by changes in thyroid
  hormones in the brain that respond to day length as signalled by the
  pineal hormone melatonin. A study collecting light quality across
  seasons using wearable colour-sensitive ‘actiwatch’ devices in human
  subjects showed that summer subjects were exposed to twice as much
  blue light than winter
  subjects<sup><xref alt="87" rid="ref-RN1002-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></sup>.
  The spectral sensitivity of the photopigment melanopsin, located in
  the human inner retina is known to be greatest for blue light and has
  been shown to mediate many aspects of non-vision related human
  behaviour and physiology such as sleep timing and daily melatonin
  rhythms<sup><xref alt="87" rid="ref-RN1002-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></sup>.
  The relative contribution of blue light is therefore greater in summer
  compared to winter, and while blue-enriched light has positive effects
  on sleep quality, alertness and
  performance<sup><xref alt="89" rid="ref-RN1004-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">89</xref></sup>,
  the timing of blue light is important such that exposure at night with
  the overuse of electronic devices rich in LED exacerbates social
  jetlag<sup><xref alt="90" rid="ref-RN1005-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref alt="91" rid="ref-RN1006-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">91</xref></sup>,

        <p>In comparison to the well characterised circadian clocks, other
  biological timers – circatidal clocks, linked to the ~12.4-h tidal
  cycle, and circalunar clocks, cycling every ~29.5 days – are less well
  understood and hotly debated to the present
  day<sup><xref alt="95" rid="ref-RN1023-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">95</xref></sup>.
  Both circalunar rhythms and circatidal rhythms are widespread in
  marine environments, but recent evidence suggests their potential
  influence on human
  health<sup><xref alt="96" rid="ref-RN1014-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">96</xref></sup>.
  Experiments in sleep laboratories, in which external light sources
  such as moonlight were systematically excluded, show the effect of the
  lunar cycle on sleep, with deep sleep patterns and total sleep time
  negatively and significantly reduced around full
  moon<sup><xref alt="97" rid="ref-RN1013-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup>.
  Circatidal clocks are used by marine organisms to anticipate changes
  linked with the ebb and flow of tides, such as water levels, food
  availability, currents and
  temperature<sup><xref alt="95" rid="ref-RN1023-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">95</xref></sup>
  and a recent seminal study in humans intriguingly demonstrated 12-h
  rhythms in gene transcript
  levels<sup><xref alt="98" rid="ref-RN1024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">98</xref></sup>.
  However there remains a debate as to the potential function of a 12-h
  mammalian clock - after all why would terrestrial animals need a ~12 h
  rhythm generator if they are not subjected to tides. One line of
  thinking is that a mammalian 12-h clock is either an evolutionary
  remnant of the marine circatidal clock or has evolved convergently,
  and that it facilitates the ‘rush hour’ processing of elevated gene
  expression and processing around dawn and
  dusk<sup><xref alt="99" rid="ref-RN1025-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">99</xref></sup>.
  The clear characterisation of circatidal and circalunar rhythmicity in
  humans is challenging at the practical level, requiring strict control
  of light sources, as well as meal and sleep timing, and there remains
  the problem of elucidating if 12-h rhythms are mechanistically driven
  by the circadian clock, rather than by a dedicated oscillator, or
  simply driven by environmental cues such as
  light<sup><xref alt="95" rid="ref-RN1023-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">95</xref></sup>.
  A link between immune function and the potential twice daily
  circatidal rhythm anticipation of metabolic stress or circalunar
  rhythm sleep pattern modulation has not been made. Immunity, sleep,
  and metabolism are however intricately intertwined and understanding
  the influence of ultradian rhythms (period shorter than a day) and
  infradian rhythms (period longer than a day) on immune function
  homeostasis will pave the way to appreciating immune processes across
  different timescales.</p>

        <p>Populations therefore feature a rich mixture of chronotypes,
  young/old clocks with natural variation in our genetically
  predetermined lark and owl propensities interacting with, and
  ultimately being shaped by, their surroundings; for example,

        <p>Naturally, the question as to whether daily variations in our
  immune response extends to our antibody response to vaccination has
  been posed. Early work showed mixed evidence for effects of time of
  vaccination on antibody response, possibly as a reflection of low
  sample sizes, variable design, short-term follow-up, and differences
  in vaccine types. However, a large-scale cluster-randomised trial
  examined the influence of the timing of vaccination on influenza
  antibody titres and found that morning vaccination enhanced the
  antibody response to the influenza
  vaccine<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup>.
  Using a prospective cohort study design Zhang <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup>
  showed that vaccination in the morning lead to a stronger immune

  <italic>et

  coined the term ‘chronovaccination’ – a term encapsulating the
  evidence of clock gating of the immune response and the potential of
  TODV for maximising vaccine immunogenicity. The authors highlighted
  four clinical studies demonstrating TODV, including the aforementioned

  different vaccination times for the influenza

  The work by Zhang <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup>
  demonstrated that vaccination in the morning (9 am - 11 am) compared
  to vaccination in the afternoon (3 pm - 5 pm) lead to a stronger
  immune response to an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV,
  Sinopharm), while in contrast Wang <italic>et

  showed, with vaccinating mRNA or Adenovirus based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
  (Pfizer, mRNA bnt162b2 or AstraZeneca, Adenoviral AZD1222) in a larger
  cohort, that antibody responses were higher in those who were
  vaccinated later in the day (11 am - 10 pm) compared to those
  vaccinated in the morning (7 am - 11 am). Wang <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="101" rid="ref-RN1020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">101</xref></sup>
  speculated that the use of the inactivated whole virus in the Zhang

  study might explain the difference in the TODV outcomes, and note
  several other potential factors complicating interpretation of the
  outcomes including altered sleep and shift-work patterns of the
  healthcare worker participants of the study potentially influencing
  vaccine responses.</p>
        <p>Recently Hazan <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>
  carried out a retrospective large population cohort analysis of
  timestamped COVID-19 vaccinations (1.5M individuals, age &gt; 12 yo,
  99.2% receiving Pfizer-produced BNT162b2), using COVID-19 breakthrough
  infection and COVID-19–associated emergency department visits and
  hospitalisations as endpoints for cohorts split by vaccination timing
  (morning, afternoon, or evening). This study found lowest rates of
  breakthrough infection with late morning to early afternoon
  vaccination and highest rates associated with evening vaccination.
  Vaccination timing remained significant after adjustment for patient
  age, sex, and comorbidities. The benefits of daytime vaccination were
  concentrated in younger (&lt;20 years old) and older patients (&gt;50
  years
  old)<sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>.
  Although vaccinations were not performed across 24-h cycles, the
  authors were able to demonstrate that the risk of COVID-19
  breakthrough infection as a function of vaccination timing was
  sinusoidal in shape, displaying a periodicity of between 7.4 and 16.7
  hours, considerably shorter than the classical 24-h periodicity of
  circadian rhythms, suggesting that rhythms in vaccine effectiveness
  are potentially ultradian in nature, for example driven by a mammalian
  12-h
  clock<sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>.
  Another retrospective large population cohort study (0.25M
  individuals, age &lt; 6 yo), this time for the varicella vaccine,
  showed that vaccination in the morning and afternoon was associated
  with lower infection rates than evening
  vaccination<sup><xref alt="103" rid="ref-RN1045-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>.
  Like that for the risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, varicella
  infection risk, after adjusting for ethnicity, sex, immunodeficiency,
  and obesity, followed a sinusoidal pattern consistent with a diurnal
  rhythm in vaccine effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Two independent systematic
  reviews<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  have surveyed published studies on the human immune response to
  vaccination at different times of day in order to gauge the evidence
  supporting diurnal variation in the effectiveness of vaccination. Wyse
  <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  noted the challenge in generalising the findings based on the
  heterogeneity of the studies surveyed, however the authors concluded
  that overall there was insufficient overall evidence that
  administration of vaccines at different times of day affected immune
  outcomes. On the other hand, Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  concluded that that morning vaccination enhanced antibody responses in
  adults aged 60 years and older, noting that this age group is a key
  demographic for influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. Studies qualified
  for inclusion in the Vink <italic>et al.</italic> review if they
  measured antigen-specific antibody or T-cell responses following
  vaccination, and if these immune responses were compared between
  participants vaccinated at different time points during the day,
  whereas for Wyse <italic>et al.</italic> studies were included if they
  reported any immune or clinical outcome following vaccination at a
  defined time of day.</p>
        <p>The Wyse <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  review assessed over 3,100 studies, 23 of which met their inclusion
  criteria. These studies were published between 1967 and 2024 and
  almost half of them included reported data collected for SARS-CoV-2
  vaccination programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review authors
  found that most studies were biased by failing to account for immune
  status prior to vaccination, self-selection of vaccination time, or
  due to the presence of confounding factors such as sleep, chronotype,
  and shift work. Of these 23 studies, the optimum TODV was concluded to
  be afternoon (5 studies), morning (5 studies), morning and afternoon
  (1 study), midday (1 study), and morning or late afternoon (1 study),
  with the remaining 10 studies reporting no effect. Of the studies that
  reported an association between TODV and outcome of vaccination, 3
  presented data that could be used to estimate the size of this
  effect<sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref alt="105" rid="ref-RN1032-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">105</xref></sup>.
  For example, Hazan <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></sup>
  estimated that optimising the time of vaccination might improve
  vaccine effectiveness by 8.6–25%.</p>
        <p>Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  identified 860 records through their literature search, 17 of which
  met their eligibility criteria; five investigated the effect of
  vaccination timing on immune responses to influenza
  vaccines<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref alt="85" rid="ref-RN999-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref alt="106" rid="ref-RN1036-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>–<xref alt="108" rid="ref-RN1038-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">108</xref></sup>
  and nine explored how time of day influences immune responses to
  SARS-CoV-2
  vaccines<sup><xref alt="100" rid="ref-RN957-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref alt="101" rid="ref-RN1020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref alt="105" rid="ref-RN1032-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,<xref alt="109" rid="ref-RN1039-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>–<xref alt="114" rid="ref-RN1044-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">114</xref></sup>.
  Eleven out of the 17 studies reported statistically significant
  effects of vaccination timing, with ten reporting stronger antibody
  responses following morning vaccination, while one study favoured
  vaccination later in the day. The strongest evidence for diurnal
  variation was found for influenza vaccines in older adults; sub-group
  analysis for age stratification in the included studies consistently
  showed stronger antibody responses for 60-year-olds or older for
  morning vs afternoon vaccination. Pooled results from two randomised
  controlled
  trials<sup><xref alt="84" rid="ref-RN956-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref alt="106" rid="ref-RN1036-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">106</xref></sup>
  for influenza vaccination showed a statistically significant
  small-to-medium standardised mean difference (SMD) in antibody titers
  for adults aged 65 and older (effect size; SMD = 0.32, 95% CI =
  0.21–0.43), with morning vaccination consistently yielding higher
  titers 1 month post-vaccination. However, Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  caution over-interpretation of this reported effect size due to the
  limited number of randomised controlled trials used in the
  meta-analysis.</p>

        <title>7 Discussion</title>
        <p>The role of circadian rhythms in many diverse strands of modern
  society are increasingly apparent, in areas such as health and
  well-being - from increasing understanding of chronic clock disruption
  (e.g., shift work, social jet lag) through to optimal living – the
  integration of personal circadian rhythms into daily schedules for
  eating, exercising, and sleeping to maximise health and performance,
  increasingly regarded as a ‘game changer’ in elite sports
  regimes<sup><xref alt="24" rid="ref-RN1047-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.
  Another example, in agriculture – harnessing knowledge of crop clocks
  to increase yields and resilience, more and more topical with the
  gathering storm of climate change and food security
  challenges<sup><xref alt="28" rid="ref-RN911-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.
  Both examples under the cloak of cultural disconnect from natural
  cycles of light and dark and the insidious creep of artificial light,
  including blue light at inappropriate phases of our day. Modern
  lifestyles embolden living against our natural clock settings, yet
  decades of fundamental scientific research in biological clockwork,
  rewarded with the 2017 Nobel prize in Physiology or
  Medicine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-nb-article">5</xref>, are offering
  opportunities to harness aspects of clock function as chronotherapies.
  One such therapy – chronovaccination - might offer an extra edge in
  vaccine effectiveness. However, is the current evidence strong enough
  to support the idea that it can be a low-cost, low-risk strategy for
  boosting vaccine effectiveness? The case for chronovaccination –
  surveyed in systematic
  reviews<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  – is somewhat patchy. While the influence of TODV is compelling in
  animal studies where environmental conditions are strictly
  controlled<sup><xref alt="76" rid="ref-RN988-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref alt="80" rid="ref-RN993-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup>,
  human populations feature a panoply of individual clock types set in a
  multitude of environments. Young clocks, teenage clocks, old clocks,
  with their spectrum of lark and owl clock ‘settings’. Clocks in rural
  and modern industrial environments, seasonal clocks, socially
  jetlagged clocks - all muddling interpretation of human circadian
  studies assessing the effect of TODV. Large population cohort
  epidemiological studies have been successful in teasing apart
  relationships between our endogenous clock function and the
  environment – for example revealing the association between where we
  live in a Time Zone and
  chrono-disruption<sup><xref alt="13" rid="ref-RN1021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.
  Population-level approaches have also been used in chronovacination
  studies<sup><xref alt="102" rid="ref-RN954-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref alt="103" rid="ref-RN1045-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>,
  but report modest effect sizes and suffer from potential biases due to
  non-randomisation of cohorts. Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  demonstrated that the strongest evidence for diurnal variation in
  vaccination effectiveness was found for influenza vaccines using
  randomised control trials and Wyse <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  argue that large population randomised trials are the ideal, with the
  power of thousands of participants enabling adjustment for multiple
  demographic and lifestyle factors that might otherwise confound
  detection of an effect of TODV. These would be costly enterprises, but
  Wyse <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
  reason that the onus of determining whether effectiveness is a
  function of the TODV should fall to the vaccine producers during
  clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Even if there was a compelling advantage of TODV, would it be
  readily integrated into vaccination programmes? One only has to look
  at the debate around Daylight Saving Time
  (DST)<sup><xref alt="115" rid="ref-RN1048-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">115</xref></sup>
  to understand the sensitive nature of policies that have disruptive
  effects on social routines. Another relevant example is the idea of
  later school start times for adolescents – designed to align better
  with their clock driven ‘owl’ behaviours – that illustrates how
  interventions, however well intended, can shift the problem onto other
  groups of individuals, in this case later scheduling working against
  teachers and parents own chronotypes and social schedules. Would the
  potential benefit of TODV justify its disruption to well-established
  vaccination programming? On the one hand boosted vaccine effectiveness
  can help improve vaccine hesitancy, with hesitancy identified by the
  WHO as one of the 10 threats to global
  health<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-nb-article">6</xref>. On the other hand, the
  convenience of accessing vaccinations is an important factor for
  vaccine
  uptake<sup><xref alt="2" rid="ref-RN928-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>,
  and programs scheduled across much of the day offer individual choice
  and convenience that may be expected in a 24-7 society. Conceivably
  immunisation initiatives more narrowly aligned to an optimum TODV may
  be detrimental to vaccine uptake, although nudging based interventions
  have shown potential in bolstering intention to
  vaccinate<sup><xref alt="116" rid="ref-RN1050-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">116</xref></sup>,
  and may therefore be a useful strategy for fostering confidence in
  time-of-day vaccinations.</p>
        <p>While the benefits of TODV across whole populations remains
  marginal, a clearer case can be made for chronovaccination in adults
  60 years and older, where morning vaccination was more
  beneficial<sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>.
  It has been speculated that immunosenescence - the gradual age-related
  decline in both innate and adaptive immune function - may play a
  role<sup><xref alt="106" rid="ref-RN1036-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref alt="117" rid="ref-RN1051-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">117</xref></sup>.
  Similarly, immunosuppressed individuals might benefit from
  TODV-mediated boosted vaccine
  effectiveness<sup><xref alt="113" rid="ref-RN1043-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,<xref alt="114" rid="ref-RN1044-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">114</xref></sup>,
  suggesting that TODV may find a role in targeted age group and
  co-morbidity cohorts. The potential of infant chronovaccination is
  largely an unexplored area, with most studies focussed on adult
  COVID-19 and influenza programmes. A recent study, however, examined
  diurnal patterns of varicella vaccine effectiveness in children -
  finding that immunisation during the late morning to early afternoon
  led to fewer breakthrough infections compared with those vaccinated in
  the
  evening<sup><xref alt="103" rid="ref-RN1045-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>.
  And what of urban-rurality? How might ‘Place’ - the extent of coupling
  to ‘sun time’ - influence sensitivity to TODV? This and the influence
  of seasonality, for example, on TODV are largely unexplored and might
  contribute to understanding the complex relationship between the
  environment, clocks, and immune function. Although a discussion of the
  role of sleep in immune function, and therefore its contribution
  chronovaccination, is not developed in this review, Livieratos
  <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="118" rid="ref-RN1058-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">118</xref></sup>
  have reviewed the evidence of the impact of circadian and sleep
  factors on influenza vaccine-induced immune responses, emphasising
  that yet another variable – sleep duration – should be considered for
  understanding vaccine-induced antibody responses.</p>
        <p>It was hoped that the award of the clock biology Nobel Prize in
  2017 would emphasise the time-of-day reporting in biology and
  medicine. However, Nelson <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="37" rid="ref-RN917-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>
  report that the time-of-day variable remains largely ignored. Much
  commentary on the future direction of chronovaccination emphasise the
  importance of systematically recording the time-of-day at which
  vaccines are administered, yet to many chronobiologists it remains a
  puzzle why such a fundamental biological variable is regularly
  overlooked in the first place. One factor may be the increased
  resources and costs that accompany properly designed multi time-point
  circadian assays; however circadian biologists would no doubt argue
  that biological studies cannot be reliably replicated – a fundamental
  tenet of science – unless time-of-day is recorded. Another important
  consideration is that internal biological time (circadian phase) can
  vary considerably, the consequence of modern lifestyles and the high
  chance of desynchrony due to many of the Person, Place and Time
  factors described here
  (<xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-variables-nb-article">Table 1</xref>). For example,
  nurses’ circadian rhythms in body temperature have been shown to be
  significantly misaligned due to shift working patterns, causing work
  and sleep schedules to be out of phase with each
  other<sup><xref alt="119" rid="ref-RN1052-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">119</xref></sup>.
  Both external time of vaccination and internal (biological) time
  recording are therefore important factors, with internal time
  recording representing a particular technical
  challenge<sup><xref alt="53" rid="ref-RN1012-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>.
  However, research on circadian wearable devices that continuously
  track body movement, heart rate, temperature, and light exposure has
  increased significantly over the past decade, are continually
  improving and offer a non-invasive method to capturing real-life
  circadian
  rhythms<sup><xref alt="26" rid="ref-RN1054-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>‘Time will tell’ if chronovaccination finds a role in delivering an
  edge to vaccine effectiveness. There remain many challenges, not only
  in establishing clear clinical benefits, but other hurdles akin to
  practical and societal issues. The general public’s growing interest
  of the role of circadian rhythms in relation to health and well-being,
  or ‘circadian hygiene’, might ultimately drive individual awareness of
  optimal times for vaccination. Therefore, as Vink <italic>et
  al.</italic><sup><xref alt="104" rid="ref-RN1035-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">104</xref></sup>
  allude to in their review, the future vaccine customer may well regard
  optimal vaccination as an hourly continuous variable in relation to
  their personal circadian phase rather than the more blunt binary
  (morning <italic>vs</italic> afternoon) variable we currently
  consider.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="conclusions-nb-article">
        <title>8 Conclusions</title>
        <p>Chronovaccination studies have been demonstrably hampered by the
  panoply of confounding factors inherent to population structures and
  our modern lifestyles. Understanding endogenous human biological
  time-keeping in the context of their exogenous settings is likely key
  to disentangling the relative influences of covariates. Nonetheless,
  TODV as a chronotherapy shows promise for older age and
  immunosuppressed groups, and while the effect size may prove to be
  modest, their practical significance could be viewed as a marginal
  gain in vaccine effectiveness, in the same way that knowledge of
  clockwork is harnessed as a competitive advantage in numerous other
  areas of society. Key hurdles in the adoption of chronovaccination are
  whether society buys into the idea and whether health agencies
  conclude that the fragility of vaccine uptake might ultimately be
  further jeopardised by changes to well established vaccination
  programmes.</p>
